This assignment was challenging because it was hard to come up with password strength algorithms that returned 'weak' for passwords
that were slight modifications of known weak passwords. For example, the password 'password' is obviously a weak password, however,
it was difficult to return 'weak' for passwords like 'Password' or 'password1'.  This assignment was much more manageable in terms of 
time commitment, compared to previous assignments.
